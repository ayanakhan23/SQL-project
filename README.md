This repository showcases my SQL problem-solving achievements on HackerRank, where I earned a 5 Star SQL Badge by successfully completing challenges across core SQL topics, 
including queries, joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions, and database design principles. The uploaded badge screenshot serves as verified proof of my SQL proficiency
and consistent performance. This accomplishment demonstrates my ability to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data from relational databases, write optimized 
SQL queries, and apply logical thinking to solve real-world database problems, reinforcing my readiness for data analysis and
backend-related projects.
